- Clean up punctuation vs ID usage, needs to be the latter
- Implement string constants
- Correct function argument parsing, odd behavior with ml-antlr when * or ? applied to non-simple rule
- Parser: tuples
- Parser: sequences
- Parser: record selector (and may want to simplify rule to be #lab exp vs #lab as being an exp)
- Parser: handle multiple declarations in let in end
- Parser: handle valdec with multiple names (for tuples), probably want to have TupleValdec
