- Clean up punctuation vs ID usage, needs to be the latter
- Implement string constants [only escape sequence not working]
- Parser: record selector (and may want to simplify rule to be #lab exp vs #lab as being an exp)
- Parser: constrain operators, and likely introduce an Op datatype
- Do away with this Arg list business for functions, fundec and valdec and have patterns instead
